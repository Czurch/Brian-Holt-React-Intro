# Brian-Holt-React-Intro
The completed project from Brian Holt's Frontend Masters course "Complete Intro to React".

The Adopt-Me project makes calls to petfinder.com and uses data passed to generate a list of animals up for adoption.
Users can filter the available animals and be directed to the page of an animal they wish to adopt.
